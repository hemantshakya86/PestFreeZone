This folder contains prompt templates for AI assistants to create or modify solution/project scaffolding for this repository.

Files:
- `create-multi-project-solution.md` — prompt template to create a multi-project solution (Core/Application/Infrastructure) and wire projects into the solution.
- `add-di-registration.md` — prompt template to add dependency injection registration helpers and call them from `Program.cs`.

Usage: Copy one of these prompts into your AI assistant input when you want it to perform the described task. Adjust project names and paths if you refactor further.
